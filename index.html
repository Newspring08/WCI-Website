            <h3>OUR BELIEFS</h3>
            <p>
                We believe that the bible is the inspired ( God breathed ) infallible ( all true ) and inerrant (without error or contradiction) Word of God. It is the supreme and final authority in faith and practice.
                We believe in the trinity; one God who exists in three distinct persons; Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
                We believe Jesus Christ is the son of God and Savior of the world.
                We believe Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross and on the third day He rose triumphant over death.
                We believe that there is no other name given that man should be saved by but the name of Jesus Christ.
                We believe that Jesus Christ is coming again.</p>

              <h2><strong>R</strong>ev Tunde Gideon & Pastor Folashade Gideon</h2>
              <p>Tunde Gideon is a preacher, Worshipper and an Evangelist raised to bring healing to the people and freedom to the captives. <br> He could be described in similitude of Apostle Paul who is ready to jeopardize his life for the things of the Kingdom of God.  He had rather face death than cease from spreading the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.  This has to do with his very humble beginning with the Lord, after all he was almost loosing his life in a deadly sickness when he had the call of God in 1992.  So why wouldnâ€™t he live or die for him.  He has lived in this vision of spreading the gospel for sixteen (16) years of his life.  Preaching to the lost in local assemblies and mass crusades all over the country.  He has also ministered in various international and local summits and seminars. 

                Tunde Gideon found the Lord in September 1987 in his school days as an undergraduate.  After college, he was in business when he had the call of God in his life for a total separation as a vessel of healing, praise and power.  This call gave birth to <strong class="WCG">Worshippers City Global</strong>  in 1992.  He organizes and ministers in crusades, preaching the message of salvation, deliverance, healing, revival and hope to a countless thousands of hopeless and needy.....</p>
